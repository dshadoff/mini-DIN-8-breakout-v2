# mini-DIN-8-breakout-v2

This is a trivial project made in the EAGLE PC Board design package, to
simply the connections for a DIN-8 connector (specifically, the joypad
port for the PC Engine game machine), to simplify breadboarding projects
which use the PC Engine joypad.

This project also includes the Gerber files, which you can download and
send to your favorite PC Board fabrication company, to make some for
yourself.
